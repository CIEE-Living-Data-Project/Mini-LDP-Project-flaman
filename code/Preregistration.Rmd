<!-- To keep pre-registrations to a reasonable length for readers, we recommend answers fit within a single page .pdf document, roughly 3200 characters. Read more about this here: https://aspredicted.org/messages/why_limits.php -->

## Data collection

<!-- Have any data been collected for this study already? (Note: "Yes" is not an accepted answer.) -->

**Yes**, the data comes from Gross et al. 2022.

## Hypothesis

<!-- What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study? -->

> How much carbon does the shelter belts of Alberta sequester and what is the benefit of this?

## Dependent variable

<!-- Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured. -->

> Amount of carbon stored in each individual plant.

## Conditions

<!-- How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to? -->

> Pending.

## Analyses

<!-- Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis. -->

> TBD.

## Outliers and exclusions

<!-- Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations. -->

> TBD.

## Sample size

<!-- How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about _exactly_ how the number will be determined. -->

> Sample size for this mini project is 10 (hedge grows and shelter belts).

## Other

<!-- Anything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?) -->

## Study type

Observational/archival study
