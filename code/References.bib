	abstract = {Accurate estimation of greenhouse gas emissions and detailed monitoring of the carbon cycle are important for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. On agricultural land, annual herbaceous vegetation is not considered a carbon sink, whereas perennial woody vegetation accumulates biomass over multiple years and does represent a carbon sink. This paper presents a study to estimate aboveground woody carbon stock in 1990 and its annual change from 1990 to 2000 on Canada’s cropland. The cropland was stratified into zones according to soils, climate and cropping systems, within which sample plots were randomly selected and paired aerial photographs corresponding to circa 1990 and 2000 were interpreted to detect changes in perennial woody vegetation such as trees, shrubs, orchards and vineyards. Woody biomass volumes lost as a result of land use change and gained as a result of planting and growth were estimated using species composition and growth rates typical of each zone, as obtained from published literature, forest reports and charts and forestry expert knowledge. Census of agriculture data was used to scale up the sample level results to zone and national levels. Results showed that on Canada’s cropland, the aboveground woody carbon stock in 1990 was 33.7±8.8Tg. Between 1990 and 2000, the area covered by woody vegetation was affected negatively by removals and positively through planting and natural regeneration, leading to a net reduction in area. There was an annual increase of about 78.3Gg over all cropland in Canada, with a net decrease in some ecozones. Although this is a comparatively small increase with a large uncertainty, it indicates that changes in woody carbon on cropland in Canada over the 1990–2000 period were relatively insignificant. Further studies may be needed to refine the carbon estimates and reduce uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Abstract In order to better understand factors affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canadian agroforestry systems, we conducted a laboratory incubation study to assess N2O, CO2 and CH4 emissions from soils in response to land use (forestland vs. cropland) and agroforestry system type (hedgerow vs. shelterbelt) in central Alberta, Canada. Emissions of N2O were lower in soils from forestland than cropland, and forest soils acted as a net sink of atmospheric CH4 while cropland soils were weak sources of CH4. However, the forest soil had higher CO2 emission rates than the cropland soil within both agroforestry systems. Soil CH4 oxidation was higher in soil from hedgerow (consisted of natural forest vegetation) than from shelterbelt system (planted forest vegetation), while the former also had lower N2O emissions. Overall, soil CO2 emissions were significantly higher from hedgerow than from shelterbelt systems. Emissions of N2O were positively related with gross nitrification rates and soil pH, and negatively related with gross N immobilization rates. The CO2 emissions were positively related with water-soluble organic C contents, while CH4 emissions were positively related with clay content, but negatively with gross N immobilization rates and soil organic C content. The global warming potential was higher in forestland soil than in cropland soil within agroforestry systems, and higher in forestland soil of the hedgerow compared to that in shelterbelts. Our results suggest that we need to select land uses or agroforestry systems that have a higher potential of mitigating GHG emissions from soils.},

	abstract = {Agroforestry systems (AFS) are increasingly being recognized as sustainable land-use systems that can increase carbon (C) sequestration and improve food security. However, the relative contributions of various C pools to the overall C stock of AFS and their dependence on factors such as tree age, species diversity and density is still unclear in many regions. Using an equivalent soil mass approach, we investigated the effect of three different AFS (hedgerow, shelterbelt, and silvopasture) and their component land-use types (treed areas and adjacent cropland/grassland) on various C pools across 36 sites in central Alberta, Canada. On average, the treed area within AFS stored 178.5 t ha−1 more C relative to adjacent cropland or grassland, although the total C stock did not differ among the three AFS types. Most of the C in the treed area of AFS was stored in the mineral soil (61\%), overstory trees (28\%), and the LFH (litter, partially decomposed litter and humus, 10\%) layer, while midstory trees, shrubs, and understory vegetation together accounted for the remaining 1\% of the C storage. The C stock size in the treed area was closely associated with tree stand characteristics of the three AFS, with the C pool size in the LFH positively related to tree age. Our results highlight that the amount of C stored in the LFH layer is substantial and should be considered when assessing C storage within AFS and suggest that investing in AFS can be an effective strategy for meeting part of Canada's C reduction goals to mitigate climate change.},
