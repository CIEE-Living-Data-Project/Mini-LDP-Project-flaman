This mini project is for the Living Data Project Course Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution for the Fall 2022.

In this R Project, you will find folders to do with code, data, and outputs. I have also practiced making README files and LICENCE files as well as a .bib file, a .csl, a preregistration using R Markdown and a manuscript using R Markdown.

For this project, I have connected my R Project with Git (to GitHub), OSF, and Zotero.
